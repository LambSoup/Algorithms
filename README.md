# Algorithms
Study and implementation of algorithms and Data Structure

## Purpose
  Each algorithm has or will have a page on the Wiki to provide a broad idea of the algorithm. We recommended, if you don't know the algorithm, to read about the algorithm on the Wiki before looking at the code. By seeing the explanation of the algorithm you will have a better undertanding about the algorithm.
